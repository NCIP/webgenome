Welcome to the WebGenome Project!
=====================================
Webgenome can be used to create genome plots and chromosome ideograms from array based data. Version 2.3 provides a client plotting service to external applications, such as Rembrandt. Users must enter webGenome through redirection from another application; the only way to load data is by selecting it in the referring client application.
    
The WebGenome is an Open Source project and it is written in Java using Apache Batik, Apache Commons, caCORE CSM, caBIO, caArray client, JBoss, Spring Framework, Struts.
