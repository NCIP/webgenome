<h1>WebGenome 2.0 Administration Manual</h1>

<h2>1.  INSTALLATION</h2>

<h3>1.1  System Requirements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Java 1.4</li>
	<li>Jakarta Tomcat 5.0 (5.0.28 recommended)</li>
	<li>Recent version of Ant, if building system</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2  Building System</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Unzip the distribution in a suitable directory location.</li>
	<li>Open a command window or shell.</li>
	<li>Change to the <em>WEBGENOME_ROOT</em> directory.</li>
	<li>Type 'ant all' at the prompt.  This will result in the creation of a WAR file
		<em>WEBGENOME_ROOT/dist/webGenome.war</em> as well as the generation of
		Javadoc API documentation in the <em>WEBGEONME_ROOT/doc/api</em> directory.
	</li>
</ol>


<h3>1.3  Installing System</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
		Copy the file <em>WEBGENOME_ROOT/dist/webGenome.war</em> to <em>TOMCAT/webapps</em>.  Alternatively,
		unzip the WAR file in a suitable locatation (denoted <em>WEBGENOME_INSTALL_DIR</em>) and use the Tomcat administration tool to create a new
		context.  Set the document base to <em>WEBGENOME_INSTALL_DIR</em>.  It may be necessary to copy the file
		<em>WEBGENOME_INSTALL_DIR/WEB-INF/lib/j2ee.jar</em> to <em>TOMCAT/shared/lib</em> if webGenome will
		not start properly.
	</li>
	<li>Move the directory <em>WEBGENOME_ROOT/db</em> to a permanant location.  This directory contains Cloudscape and
	Excel databases uses by the system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4  Configuring System</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Open the file <em>WEBGENOME_INSTALL_DIR/WEB-INF/classes/webcgh.properties</em> with a text editor.  Set the sysadmin properties appropriately.</li>
	<li>Set the embedded Cloudscape database and Excel "database" properties to the absolute paths to embedded database and
	Excel files, respectively.  Recall that these directories were copied in a permanant location in section 1.3 above.</li>
</ol>


<h2>2.  ADMINISTRATION</h2>
<p>
Administration of webGenome consists primarily of periodically updating the embedded database
with new cytoband, probe location, genomic annotation, and SKY/M-FISH&CGH data.  All data must
be uploaded in tab-delimited text format.  The system comes
with both web-based and command line administrative tools for performing these functions.  Command
line tools are located in the directory <em>WEBGENOME_ROOT/bin</em>.  Currently all tools run only on
Windows platforms.  Before invoking any of the tools you must set the WEBCGH_HOME environment variable
to point to a directory containing the webGenome web application files (e.g. <em>TOMCAT/webapps/webGenome</em>).
</p>
<p>
In order to invoke the web interfaces for these tools you must log into webGenome as 'admin.'  The admin
password is set in the <em>webcgh.properties</em> file (see section 1.3).
