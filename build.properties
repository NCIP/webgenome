# You must change this by hand at the minute.
# If you didn't do a cvs tag operation to explicitly create a tag in cvs,
# then just leave this alone, i.e. DO NOT EDIT.
# Don't forget to do this whenever you create a new build release tag.

# PROPERTIES FOR BUILD AND TESTING AUTOMATION

#    * webui
#    * war
#    * deploy
#    * run-systest
#    * format-test-reports
#    * all
#
# If any other targets are called, then these properties
# are not read and do not need editing.
