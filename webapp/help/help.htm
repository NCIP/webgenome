<br>
<p>
		
<p>
			WebGenome 3.0 is a web application for
			creating genomics plots of array-based data
			and genomic annotations.  Users may enter WebGenome 3.0
			through redirection
			from another application or by loggin in and uploading
			data from an SMD (Stanford Micorarray Database) format
			rectangular text file.
			Data types supported in this version include
			copy number (i.e., aCGH),
			<a href="#loh">loss of heterozygosity (LOH)</a>,
			and gene expression.  Five basic types of plots
			can be generated:
		</p>
		
		
<ul>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<a href="#genomeSnapshotPlot">Genome Snapshot Plots</a> -
					
				Plots all data from selected experiment(s) across entire
				genome in one graph proving a snapshot of copy number,
				loss of heterozygosity, or expression levels
			</li>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<a href="#scatterPlot">Scatter Plots</a> -
					
				Plots DNA copy number measurements, LOH, or expression levels
				across specified chromosomal interval(s)
			</li>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<a href="#ideogramPlot">Ideogram Plots</a> -
					
				Shows chromosomal amplifications
				and deletions in relation to cytogenetic chromosome ideograms.
			</li>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<a href="#annotationPlot">Annotation Plots</a> -
					
				Plots data over a specified chromosomal interval along
				with annotated sequence features from that interval
			</li>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<a href="#barPlot">Bar Plots</a> -
					
				Plots data from selected reporters using a bar graph
				format.  Currently the only way to selected reports is
				through the client application (e.g. Rembrandt).
			</li>
</ul>
		
		
<p>
			The underlying data model used by webGenome is a very simplied version of
			the MAGE-OM.  The most important concept for the use of the system
			is that individual array data sets, called <em>bioassays</em> are aggregated
			into experiments.
		</p>
	
</p>
<a name="cart"></a><span class="heading1">2 - The User's Workspace</span>
<br>
<p>
		
<p>
			Each user of the system is given a workspace that holds
			data and plots.  There are currently no storage limits
			associated with workspaces.  If the user is directed to
			WebGenome throuh a client application, such as Rembrandt,
			the workspace is transitory and disappears at the end of the
			WebGenome session.  If the user logs in, any new data or plots
			accumulated during the subsequent session will be saved in the
			users workspace until explicitly deleted.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			The workspace holds accumulated raw data sets loaded by the client
			application or uploaded from file,
			statistically processed data sets derived from
			raw or other processed data, and generated plots.  For
			each experiment, the list of nested bioassays is also shown.
			Users may change the names of experiments and bioassays in this
			screen.  Names do not have to be unique and can be empty
			if desired.  Users may delete experiments and plots.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			Each bioassay has an associated color.  These colors are
			used in scatter plots to distinguish between bioassays.
			Colors are initialized by the system.  Users may change
			colors, and all future plots will use the new colors.  However,
			previously-generated plots in the cart will retain the original
			colors.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			From the workspace, users may select one or more experiments
			and generate new plots or perform analytic operations.  New plots
			and statistically processed experiments are saved back into the
			cart.
		</p>
	
</p>
<a name="jobs"></a><span class="heading1">3 - Jobs Table</span>
<br>
<p>
	
		
<p>
		Processing uploaded data, performing analytic operations, and
		generating plots may take a great deal of time with larger
		data sets.  If the amount of data is beyond a threshold
		that is set by the administrator, the system will process
		the request as a background job.  The status of all jobs
		can be accessed from a jobs page, which is accessible from
		a link at the top of the page.  Background processing will
		only be invoked if the user is logged in.  For sessions
		invoked from a client application (e.g. Rembrandt), all
		requests will be processed immediately as the size of the
		associated data sets will in most cases be relatively small.
		Hence, the jobs table link will not be visible until the
		user has logged in.  Background processing of all jobs
		will continue even after the user has logged out.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
		Historical jobs are not deleted by the system.  It is up
		to the user to purge the jobs table from time to time by
		clicking on the provided link.  Specific experiments and plots
		are associated in the system database with the job that created
		them, if they were created by a job.  It will not be possible to
		remove an experiment or plot from the user's workspace until the
		associated job is first purged.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
		When a job completes, the user will be notified.  This will occur
		at login time or during a session.  The notification will display
		at the top of the screen.  At this time, email notifications are
		not sent.
		</p>
		
	
</p>
<a name="upload"></a><span class="heading1">4 - Uploading Data</span>
<br>
<p>
	
		
<p>
		After logging into the system, the user may upload data from
		SMD (Stanford Microarray Database)
		format files into their workspace.  Data may be in one or
		more SMD format delimited text files.  The format of these files
		are as follows:
		</p>
			
		
<ul>
<a name="smdFileType"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">File Type</span> -
					
					The base file type must be CSV (comma-separated values)
					or tab delimited text.  Each row, with the exception
					of the first, corresponds to a different
					reporter (i.e. probe) reading.
				</li>
<a name="smdColHeadings"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Column Headings</span> -
					
					The first row must contain column headings,
					which indicate the content of the corresponding
					columns.  No particular column heading names
					are required.
				</li>
<a name="smdRequiredColumns"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Required Columns</span> -
					
					Each file must contain one column that provides
					reporter names.  Each upload, which may include
					one or more files, must include one file that
					gives reporter location information.  This information
					must be provided by two columns, one providing chromosome
					number (or X/Y) and one providing physical chromosomal
					location in either BP (base pairs), KB (kilo-base pairs),
					or MB (mega-base pairs).  If multiple files are uploaded
					at once, each must have the same set of reporters in the
					same order.
				</li>
<a name=""></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Data Columns</span> -
					
					Zero or more columns may provide data values.  Data
					may be in units (i.e. quantitation type)
					of copy number, log2 copy number,
					ratio of treated to controlled, log2 ratio of treated
					to controlled, or LOH value.  All analytic operations
					are plot types are available for each quantitation
					type.
				</li>
</ul>
			
		
<p>
		One or more files may be uploaded at one time.  All files included
		in a single upload must have the same number of rows and the
		same sequence of reporter names.  Multiple files may be packaged
		into a ZIP-format file.  For each data file uploaded, the system
		will ask the user to specify data-containing columns, each of which
		will be mapped into a separate bioassay.  The user may name each
		resulting bioassay.  All file uploaded together will constitute
		an experiment, which the user may name.  For each upload the user
		must indicate the columns containing chromosome number and position.
		These columns may be in any of the included files.  Files that are
		larger than a threshold size (set by the administrator) will be
		processed in the background.
		</p>
		
	
</p>
<a name="plots"></a><span class="heading1">5 - Plots</span>
<br>
<p>
	In this section we describe plotting functionality including the
	types of plots that can be generated and plotting parameters that
	can be set by the user.  Functionality to create new plots
	is accessible from the workspace screen.
	
	
		
		
		
		
	</p>
<a name="plotTypes"></a><span class="heading2">5.1 - Plot Types</span>
<br>
<p>
			WebGenome 3.0 includes three genomic plot types
			as well as a bar plot for selected reporters.
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
		</p>
<a name="genomicPlots"></a><span class="heading3">5.1.1 - Genomic Plot Types</span>
<br>
<p>
			
				
				
		
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
			
</p>
<a name="snapshotPlot"></a><span class="heading4">5.1.1.1 - Whole Genome Snapshot Plot</span>
<br>
<p>
					
<p>
					Whole genome snapshot plots display array
					reporter values (e.g. copy number) over the entire genome
					against physical genome location.  
					</p>
				
</p>
<a name="scatterPlot"></a><span class="heading4">5.1.1.2 - Scatter Plot</span>
<br>
<p>
					
<p>
					Scatter plots display array reporter values (e.g. copy number)
					from specified chromosomal location(s)
					against physical genome location.  Users can plot data points,
					regression lines, and confidence intervals in these plots.
					If data are loss of
					<a href="#loh">heterozygosity (LOH)</a>, then the
					endpoints of LOH regions are inferred and shown as
					thick horizontal lines.  The Y-coordinates of these lines
					are equal to the average probability of
					LOH weighted
					by the chromosomal distance between adjacent reporters.
					</p>
					
					
<p>
					Scatter plots provide basic interactivity.  Clicking
					on a data point causes all data points and lines from
					the bioassay to be highlighted.  Also the name of the
					selected bioassay will be outlined in the plot legend.
					Moving the
					mouse across the plot will cause a tool tip to show
					the nearest reporter.  If available, nearby genes will
					also be displayed along with arbitrary annotations that
					may be available through the client application.
					</p>
				
</p>
<a name="ideogramPlot"></a><span class="heading4">5.1.1.3 - Ideogram Plot</span>
<br>
<p>
					This plot shows color-coded data values in relation to
					chromosome ideograms.  The color coding goes from
					green to blue to red, which indicates data values that
					are low, medium, and high, respectively.  Moving the mouse
					over ideograms causes a tool tip to display the cytoband
					and physical chromosomal location under the pointer.
					Moving the mouse over data tracks causes a tool tip
					to indicate the physical chromosomal interval and data value
					under the pointer.  If available, nearby genes will
					also be displayed along with arbitrary annotations that
					may be available through the client application.
				</p>
<a name="annotationPlot"></a><span class="heading4">5.1.1.4 - Annotation Plot</span>
<br>
<p>
					Annotation plots show array data as color-coded
					values against the position of annotated genome
					features, such as genes.  The color coding goes from
					green to blue to red, which indicates data values that
					are low, medium, and high, respectively.
				</p>
<a name="barPlot"></a><span class="heading3">5.1.2 - Bar Plot</span>
<br>
<p>
				This plot graphs only selected reporters.  The measurements
				at each reporter are shown using bars.  Bars are grouped
				by reporter.  Within each reporter group, each
				measurement from a different bioassay is shown as a single
				bar.  Currently WebGenome does not provide a mechanism
				for selecting reporters.  These are selected through a
				client application (e.g. Rembrandt).
			</p>
<a name="plotParams"></a><span class="heading2">5.2 - Plotting Parameters</span>
<br>
<p>
			Plotting parameters control how data will be presented graphically.
			Some parameters that are common to all plot types,
			such as genome intervals.  Some parameters specific to one
			type of plot.  After the user elects to create a new plot
			from the workspace, a form showing parameters for
			the selected plot type is displayed.  The user may
			later change these parameter settings by clicking on
			a link above displayed plots.  Descriptions of the
			various parameters are given here.

<a name="operations"></a><span class="heading1">6 - Analytic Operations</span>
<br>
<p>
		In this section we describe the analytic operation that can
		be performed on data in the user's workspace.  Once a user
		has selected one or more experiments, they may elect to
		perform an analytic operation on these experiments.
		The resulting processed data will be deposited back in the
		user's workspace.  Analytic operations may be performed on
		all raw experiments (i.e., experiments loaded from the client
		application directory) and most processed data.  Processed
		experiments resulting from the
		<a href="#op-7">minimum common alterations</a> operation
		cannot be further processed because individual data points
		are dropped.
		
		<ul>
<a name="op-1"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Bioconductor aCGH smoother</span> -
					
				This operation invokes the aCGH hidden Markov model-based
				method from the Bioconductor software package to
				smooth data.
			</li>
<a name="op-2"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Average</span> -
					
				This operation performs chromosome position-wise averaging
				of all data points within the same experiment.
			</li>
<a name="op-3"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Range based filter</span> -
					
				This operation filters out all data with values
				between two endpoints and is
				used primarily for removing outliers.
				The upper and lower endpoints
				may be INFINITY or -INFINITY, respectively.  This operation
				includes the following parameters:
				<ul>
<a name="opParam-lowerBound"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Lower bound</span> -
					
						Lower filter endpoint
					</li>
<a name="opParam-upperBound"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Upper bound</span> -
					
						Upper filter endpoint
					</li>
</ul>
			
</li>
<a name="op-4"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Simple bioassay-based normalization</span> -
					
				This operation subtracts the bioassay specific mean or median
				from each observation. The user specifies the use of the mean
				or median as the normalization factor. The choice of median
				based normalization allows the user to lessen the effect
				of outliers.  This type of normalization is useful for making
				spot intensities comparable across arrays 
				as it removes an overall array effect; each array will be 
				"centered" on zero (or something 
				close to it if the median is used).
			</li>
<a name="op-5"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Simple experiment-based normalization</span> -
					
				This procedure subtracts the array specific mean or median from
				each observation then adds the experiment level mean or median
				back to each observation. The user specifies 
				the use of the mean or median as the normalization factor.
				The choice of median based 
				normalization allows the user to lessen the effect of outliers.
				This type of normalization 
				is useful for making spot intensities comparable across arrays 
				while preserving any overall 
				difference due to treatment effect. This will center each array 
				on the difference between 
				it's own array mean/median and the experiment wide mean/median. 
			</li>
<a name="op-6"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Sliding window smoother</span> -
					
				This operation smooths data using a "sliding window" approach. 
				The user
				specified a <em>Window size</em>.  The value of probe <em>i</em>
				is equal to the average value of probes <em>i - w/2</em> through 
				<em>i + w/2</em>, where <em>w</em> is the size of the window.
			</li>
<a name="op-7"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Minimum common alterations</span> -
					
				This operation identifies the set of common alteration across
				bioassays.  These alterations are defined by a
				<em>threshold</em> and a <em>minPercent</em> property.
				The <em>threshold</em> is used for scoring alterations.
				For instance, if the threshold is set to 0.5, then all 
				<a href="#loh">LOH</a> probability values greater than
				this value will be
				considered LOH.  The <em>minPercent</em> propety defines
				the minimum percentage of bioassays that must contain
				an alteration at a particular location for the alteration
				to be considered common.
			</li>
<a name="op-8"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Linear regression</span> -
					
				This operation peforms data smoothing using linear regression.
			</li>
<a name="op-9"></a>
<li>
<span class="propName">Loess regression</span> -
					
				This operation peforms data smoothing using Loess regression.
			</li>

<p>
			Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is detected by measuring
			the amount of DNA from each
			allele from tumor cells and comparing this with the amounts
			found from normal tissue in the same individual or a reference sample.
			A skewed distribution in the tumor cells, compared with those
			found in the normal tissue, indicates an allelic
			imbalance. This imbalance can result from either loss of an allele
			(true LOH) or allelic amplification. Some earlier articles reporting
			LOH may, for technical reasons, have measured allelic amplification
			rather than loss of an allele.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			LOH measurements are reported as the
			-log10 of the probability of continuous genomic region of
			homozygote calls.
			Thus, the larger the LOH value is, the more likely the value
			indicates a true LOH
			(or allelic amplification). The following formulae are
			used to compute LOH values:
